# AI-generated text detection

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a model to classify essays as either student-written or generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). The model helps address concerns in education related to AI-generated content.

## Approach
Using fine-tuned transformer models, we improved detection accuracy by incorporating TPU acceleration, PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning), and hyperparameter tuning through Optuna. An ensemble method was also applied to further refine predictions.

## Key Highlights
- **Fine-Tuning:** Leveraged models like Mistral-7b and DeBERTa with LoRA for efficient adaptation.
- **Performance:** Achieved a 99% ROC AUC score, demonstrating strong detection capabilities.
- **Optimization:** Applied advanced techniques such as TPU processing, cross-validation, and model ensembling for high accuracy.

## Tools & Technologies
- Hugging Face Transformers
- PyTorch
- TPU Acceleration
- LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)
- Optuna for Hyperparameter Optimization
